<p>I'm <strong>Phillip Mates</strong>, a software engineer on the Compilers team at <a href="https://igalia.com/">Igalia</a></p>

<p>
Before that I was at Nubank where I built micro-services, worked on the data platform, and was the co-maintainer of several clojure libraries related to testing: <a href="https://github.com/nubank/matcher-combinators/">matcher-combinators</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nubank/state-flow">state-flow</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/marick/midje">Midje</a>
</p>


</p>Academically speaking, I received a masters in <a href="http://prl.ccs.neu.edu/">Programming Languages</a> from <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/">Northeastern University</a>, working to establish new compiler verification proof techniques under the supervision of <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/amal/">Amal Ahmed</a>.</p>

<p>
During undergrad at the University of Utah I studied static analysis as a part of <a href="matt.might.net">Matt Might</a>'s U-Combinator lab and also worked under <a href="http://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/">Claudio Silva</a> and <a href="http://vgc.poly.edu/~juliana/">Juliana Freire</a> on various <a href="http://vistrails.org">VisTrails</a> related projects.</p>
